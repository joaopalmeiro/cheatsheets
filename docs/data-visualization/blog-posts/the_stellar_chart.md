- Stellar chart, an alternative to the radar chart.
- "Data visualization's primary objective is to present statistical information in a more accessible fashion than classic number listings (i.e. tables)."
- On a radar chart, "(...) the only piece of information that is fully data-driven is the distance between each angle and the center of the radar. (...) the rest results from complex interactions between the underlying data and a subjective, editorial decision: the ordering of categories around the circle."
- "In short, radar charts contradict one of the most basic data visualization rules: don't connect categories with lines."
- An alternative name for the radial bar/column chart could be _asterisk chart_.

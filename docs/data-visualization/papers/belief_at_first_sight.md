- "(...) Mercator projection causes northern countries to appear larger than they truly are."
- The authors "(...) argue that the implicit association with objectivity creates a risk that visualizations can be perceived uncritically and with a limited understanding of the influences that shaped their message, especially at first sight."
  - "(...) belief at first sight — the uncritical perception of visualizations as a sufficient representation of reality."
- Data Visualization as a mode of representation (Nelson Goodman's Theory of Symbols).
- In 2008, a streamgraph "(...) was a new and relatively unknown data representation. Ten years later, this format is included in automatic visualization generation tools such as [Rawgraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/) (...)."
- "In this way, this conventionally agreed-upon form of representing the visible world \[perspective\] comes to be understood as representing the world "as it is". However, scholars have argued over whether these drawing rules indeed portray perspective as the one "natural" or "correct" mode of representation of a scene, or if they instead reflect a convention for exhibiting three-dimensional scenes."
  - "It is now well known that the static eye assumption is an impossibility (...) Thus how can perspective truly portray reality when it is based on an impossibility?"
- "This leads to the idea of a camera as a mechanical or autonomous image production device that excludes human bias. If the reproduction of what is in front of the camera is automatic, then it is assumed to be objective."
  - "The film's bias in favor of Caucasian skin \["whiteness" bias\] was largely accepted by the public at the time, obscured by the dominant concept that science, the basis for film production, was based on reasoned decisions without racial or cultural considerations (...)."
- "A key feature of data visualization is that it involves two distinct and separable representational stages. First, a set of data represents some aspects of the world. Second, a data visualization represents the data set and thus becomes a representation of the world."
- "A long-running stream of data visualization research investigates the connection between visualizations and the human perceptual system (...) with the purpose of increasing the interpretability of the underlying data."
  - "Tufte's (...) data-ink ratio (...) has been debated as studies have shown that extraneous elements can improve the memorability of visualizations (...)."
  - "By viewing perspective and photography as modes of representation parallel to visualization, we see that the historical context in which each came to be associated with objectivity and rationalism continues in data visualization. It becomes clear that the data visualization community's discussions of representational accuracy are rooted in discussions of "correct" representations that have endured across many centuries and representational modes."
- "(...) most visualizations represent data that is already an imperfect or incomplete representation of the world."
  - Data provenance/lineage is an important concept for transparency.
- "Placing perspective, early photography, and data visualization along a historical continuum, we can see a **tendency to systematize and automate methods of producing representations**, from using rules, to machines, to algorithms."
- "What we see is intertwined with our individual and cultural experiences, which are influenced by the history of how visual media have been perceived — as a way to portray an objective reality."
  - "(...) from a cultural point of view, belief at first sight can also happen when a society in general views a medium as fundamentally objective without further critique."
- "Understanding visualization is a shared responsibility between those who create, acquire, or select data (data providers), those who create representations of data (visualization creators) and those who read or use the visualization (analysts and viewers)."
- Three points to keep in mind:
  - **Deeper visualization literacy**: "Studying and teaching the trajectories and critiques of analogous modes of representation can help creators and audiences alike gain awareness of and contextualize the changes happening in data visualization. Visualization creators can deepen their own visualization literacy by studying and considering data visualization as a part of the historical representation process".
  - **Awareness of black boxes**: "(...) many aspects of visualization can be hidden in "black boxes", from data collection and processing steps, to representation algorithms, to the reasoning behind design choices. Black boxes can be found where there is the greatest risk that viewers' understanding of the relationship between a visualization and the world will break down."
  - **Develop critical reflexivity in visualization**.
- Punch line: "(...) visualization is not about aspiring to show the most objective, neutral, and unbiased view, but rather about being aware of the context in which the data was collected, represented, framed and viewed, and the possible biases that may have influenced their portrayal."
- Similar to a position paper.
- History and Philosophy of Science (and more, like Nelson Goodman's Theory of Symbols) as a _vehicle_ for thinking about Data Visualization.
- Easy to read, _bite by bite_, until we reach the points we should take with us.
- The authors share a kind of summary of the transition of perspective and photography as representations of the world "as it is" to _just_ modes of representation.
- In a nutshell, the authors show us part of the path of perspective and photography as proxies to reflect on the supposed objectivity of Data Visualization.

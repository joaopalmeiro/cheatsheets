- "The concept of herd immunity is typically described in the context of a vaccine."
- "(...) prior infection has to confer immunity against future infection. While hopeful, scientists are not yet certain that this is the case, nor do they know how long this immunity might last."
- "Herd immunity doesn't stop a virus in its tracks. The number of infections continues to climb after herd immunity is reached."
  - Metaphor: "A runaway train doesn't stop the instant the track begins to slope uphill, and a rapidly spreading virus doesn't stop right when herd immunity is attained."

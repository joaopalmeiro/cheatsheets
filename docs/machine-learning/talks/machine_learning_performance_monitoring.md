- Data drift: change in feature distribution.
- Concept drift: change in underlying relationships (same feature distribution, different target class distribution, for example).
- Gradual concept drift (model retraining can help) vs. sudden concept drift.
- Monitoring:
  - Service health (memory and latency, for example) vs. data health vs. model health.
  - Add ML metrics to service health monitoring (using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for real-time models, for example) vs. prepare ML-focused reports/dashboards (for batch models, for example).

- "(...) it remains rare for many scientists to have to communicate to the public directly."
- The authors qualitatively analyzed "(...) 20 diagrams that represent journalists' redesigns of scientific graphics targeted at a general audience."
  - The authors limited their choices "(...) to graphics that were evidently derived from the original graphics."
  - The authors "(...) adopted an open-ended coding approach in which each author independently analyzed the same subset of samples. After analyzing the first subset, [the authors] (...) labeled the design strategies and created a basic taxonomy. [The authors] (...) then applied the taxonomy to the rest of [the] (...) samples, adding new labels when necessary, and resolving disagreements."
- Using bold text to identify techniques/strategies is a very good way to highlight the most important information.
- Five categories of techniques:
  - "Simplification":
    - "(...) simplify the language."
      - "(...) spell out acronyms (...)."
      - "(...) rewriting existing labels in simpler language (...)."
      - "(...) adding a description of the unit or scale (...)."
    - "(...) simplify the interpretation."
      - "(...) break the visualization into steps."
      - "Changing the measurement (...)."
      - "(...) intentionally leave out some information (...)."
      - Tricky: "(...) remove visualization of uncertainty (such as by removing error bars or descriptions of margins of error)."
    - "(...) simplification is often **not** addressed directly in more canonical examples of visualization guidance (...)."
  - "Optimizing the Visual Presentation":
    - "(...) change the colors (...)."
    - "(...) change the visual encoding (...)."
      - In one example, "(...) the researchers used a diverging color palette to show temperature from low to high, but the journalist, in the edited version, changed it to a simpler sequential color scheme (...)."
    - "(...) add a [double] visual encoding (...)."
    - "(...) add a visualization of data [(table)] (...)."
    - "(...) change orientation or ordering of parts of a figure, typically for aesthetic reasons."
  - "Adding Explanation":
    - "(...) explanation of the content (...)."
      - "(...) add title (...)."
      - "(...) provide background information or summary (...)."
    - "(...) explanation of the graph (...)."
      - "(...) add labels to part of the diagram (...)."
      - "(...) indicate how to read the graph (...) or directly interpret the pattern shown in the original graph, both typically through annotation."
  - "Making Information Relatable":
    - "(...) use more realistic illustrations."
    - "(...) add a reference to a familiar object."
    - "Adding pictorial objects purely to support recognition of some object or entity conflicts with canonical guidance like the data-ink maximization ratio (...)."
    - "(...) provide a typical case [(baseline)] for the audience to better understand the special case (...)."
  - "Miscellaneous":
    - "(...) added or changed information groupings from the original diagram."
    - "(...) add new data or information."
- "These strategies appear to be influenced by principles that run **orthogonal** to most canonical visualization design guidance, which focuses on the clarity of the encodings but does not necessarily address how to scaffold understanding through textual and graphical elements."

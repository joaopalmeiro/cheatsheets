- "The application of stand-up comedy to science communication is still uncommon but has been gaining momentum in recent years in the United States of America and the United Kingdom."
- "(...) staging science events at these "generic" locations has the potential to reach audiences with little or no interest in science activities (Bultitude and Sardo, 2012)."
- Participants (scientists):
  - 13 participants.
  - The qualitative study was carried out with 11 out of 13 participants. "The first and third authors of the present study were participants in the project and, therefore, were excluded from the analysis to avoid bias (...)."
  - 6 women and 5 men.
  - 7 different scientific areas.
  - 4 MSc researchers.
  - 6 PhD students.
  - 1 Postdoctoral researcher.
  - "Between 2009 and 2013, the group performed in science-related facilities (...) but also other types of venues (...)."
  - 36 presentations in total, "(...) with an estimated audience of over 6000 people."
- Audience:
  - Adult audience.
  - The authors obtained (quantitative) feedback from the audience (through a closed-ended questionnaire) only at **one** of the shows, more precisely from 35 out of 70 audience members. "(...) the **audience**, most of whom were young adults, and held a higher education degree, were satisfied with the show."
  - This show "(...) was done at a venue directed towards science communication [(Museu da Ciência, a science museum in Coimbra)] (...)."
  - Age (years):
    - `18–25`: 9.
    - `26–40`: 11.
    - `41–60`: 9.
    - `>60`: 6.
  - 24 women and 11 men.
  - Professional situation:
    - `Employed`: 22.
    - `Unemployed`: 1.
    - `Student`: 7.
    - `Retired`: 5.
    - `Housewife`: 0.
  - Education level completed:
    - `Primary education`: 0.
    - `Basic education`: 0.
    - `Secondary education`: 2.
    - `BSc level`: 9.
    - `MSc level`: 16.
    - `PhD level`: 8.
- "(...) some \[participants\] mentioned that they would only encourage peers who were already interested in science communication."
- "In relation to the drawbacks of using this format, several respondents said that the clarity and simplicity demanded by a science stand-up comedy act aimed at the general public could also be a limitation. (...) Concern about passing on information that was considered scientifically correct in a clear way through humour was also mentioned."
- One participant "(...) thinks that this form of science communication is effective in attracting audiences who already have an interest in science, but **may not be able to capture the attention of all the lay public**."
- "What seems to be different in the present study is that the difficulties were viewed from a positive perspective, as a challenge that could be overcome."
- "The project was open to all the local scientific community but did not attract researchers in more advanced stages of their careers."
- "The format of stand-up comedy on science could be classified as a deficit-like communication (or diffusionist model), since it is mainly a one-way communication in which scientific knowledge is popularized (...). However, it has the advantage of establishing a close relationship with the audiences, which may be explained by the use of humour, informal language and generally talking to the audience as equals."
- Quote: "It should also be said that simplicity and informality should not be confused with lack of accuracy."

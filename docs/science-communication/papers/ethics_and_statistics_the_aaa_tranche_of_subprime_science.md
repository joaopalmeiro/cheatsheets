- One of the main roles of statistics/quantitative research is to recognize and communicate uncertainty (and variation/variance), particularly important because "(...) we have a tendency to think more categorically about things as being true or false, there or not there (...)."
- Based on the above point, statistics should not be used "(...) to overstate confidence."
- The authors use an analogy ("(...) AAA-class bonds created during the mid-2000s that led to the subprime mortgage crisis.") to talk about research, especially statistical significance and the publication/peer review (qualitative) process, to highlight some problems with these instruments (commonly considered as _seals of approval_).
- The authors also complement the article with an analogy about food safety certification.
- The (main) motivation for the article is "(...) to stress how it [(the current system)] is used as a way of laundering uncertainty, creating AAA tranches of strong claims from masses of data and analyses of varying quality."
- In this way, the authors think it is necessary "(...) to accept large levels of uncertainty and to move beyond the paradigm in which effective certainty can be obtained via statistical significance and peer review."
- Statistical significance comes from "(...) high-certainty statements selected out of the many less-reliable claims."
- "The convention is to treat published claims as true unless demonstrated otherwise."
- "The two-step process — first the achievement of statistical significance, then publication — corresponds with the movement of a scientific hypothesis from the hazy [(_nebulosa_)] zone of uncertain speculation to presumed certainty."
- Three reasons why peer review does not guarantee error filtering:
  - "(...) any paper is publishable if you try enough outlets."
  - "(...) journals select on novelty as much as correctness."
  - "(...) reviewers and publishers may be independent with respect to a specific article they review, but they are not independent in that they participate in related projects and in the broader scientific enterprise where publications are the currency for success and promotion."
- The authors "(...) believe that what many researchers (...) are more likely to defend is a general _research hypothesis_, rather than the specific empirical findings."
- "(...) selection on statistical significance induces a positive bias in the magnitude of any comparison, and the reported estimate represents just one possible comparison that could have been performed on these data."
- The authors also speak of mechanisms (mitigators) that would involve money, such as scientific prediction markets.
- "(...) scientific prediction markets could be a step forward, just because it would facilitate clear predictive statements about replications. If a researcher believes in his or her theory, even while not willing to bet his or her published quantitative finding would reappear in a replication, that's fine, but it would be good to see such a statement openly made."
- The authors "(...) think the problem is that often researchers do not admit uncertainty or variation; they think they've already made their discovery, and they think of various data-collection and data-analysis rules as technicalities that should not get in the way of science."
- "A few significant _p_-values give the illusion of a high rating to the whole set of results, and this illusion of certainty is then used to justify a discussion section devoted to the general scientific hypothesis."
- To keep in mind: "Documenting the details of research studies, including all the relevant decisions in the design and the data analysis, is important for being able to reproduce, evaluate, and replicate results."
- "(...) academic researchers may feel freer to inflate the importance of their findings because they are removed from decisionmaking."
- On the Twitter thread where I found this article ([shared by Jessica Hullman](https://twitter.com/JessicaHullman/status/1315009954831650816)), there is a very interesting [comment from Enrico Bertini](https://twitter.com/FILWD/status/1314625884599529474) about the publishers: "**They sell a brand.** It's like asking why do you need a one thousand bucks Prada shirt for something you can buy at \$5."

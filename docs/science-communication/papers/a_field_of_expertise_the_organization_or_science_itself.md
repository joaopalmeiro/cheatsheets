- Modes of representation (typology):
  - Expert (field of expertise).
  - Research Manager (research organization).
  - Guardian of Science (institution of science).
- Research design:
  - Qualitative.
  - Semi-structured interviews.
  - 20 leading Danish (bio- and nanotechnology) scientists.
- "When scientists communicate publicly, they do not just disseminate knowledge, they also represent a particular sense making about what science, scientists, and scientific organizations are."
- "One study found that previous behavior is the most important predictor for whether scientists are likely to engage in public communication (Poliakoff & Webb, 2007). This implies that scientists either engage in science communication on a **continuous basis** or they **do not do it at all**."
- "Just as **top leaders of large companies** often become the central focus point for sense making about that company (Guthey, Clark, & Jackson, 2009), **top scientists** often symbolize science and its organizations in public communication."
- "Approximately one half of the interviewees seemed to move between these roles depending on the context. The other half of the interviewees talked primarily about one of the roles, but they also occasionally said things that could be ascribed to a secondary role."
  - "In practice, (...) scientists will adopt these modes of representing to a larger or lesser degree and in various combinations."
- **Field of expertise**:
  - The most common mode of representation.
  - "(...) the interviewee does not speak on behalf of his university or colleagues but only answers to himself for what he says."
  - "(...) he does not speak as a private person but that he has a particular academic position, from which he can speak knowledgably about a field."
  - "This scientist [(there is at least one other scientist who sees no problems)] does not want to be seen to talk about scientific topics outside her field of expertise."
  - "(...) communication is rarely described as a favorite activity."
  - "Their main concern when speaking in public is that the content, the facts, are correct."
  - Often, they have only vague notions about the target audience.
  - "Interviewees within biotechnology seem to have more experiences with joint collegial reflections on communication than interviewees within nanotechnology. (...) scientists within biotechnology have lived with pronounced public controversy about their field for a very long time."
  - Commenting on each other's communication activities "(...) should be done not as a part of managerial instruction but rather as a conversation between two equal researchers."
- **Research organization**:
  - "(...) their brand is primarily built on what they do (...)."
  - "They demonstrate their **research excellence** by communicating about publications in top journals, and they demonstrate **research relevance** by making it visible that they have a large number of collaborative projects with companies and other organizations."
  - They "(...) do not think it is right for them to use their managerial position to interfere with what their colleagues and group members choose to say in public."
  - "Not only can **language** be a problem in terms of communicating to a national public that is not English speaking, but this interviewee also points out that a **shared cultural frame of reference** is necessary if public science communication is to succeed."
  - "In general, the training of communication competences **does not** seem to be a systematic part of research management. (...) the interviewees drawing on this mode of representing primarily seem to understand communication skills as the result of inborn personality traits."
    - However, "(...) Research Managers might consider communication competencies as something that has to be acquired more systematically."
  - "Mostly, these interviewees seem to consider it their own duty as managers of a research group or center to represent the organization and not something they can delegate to others."
- **Institution of science**:
  - "Communication efforts (...) motivated by a wish to help citizens understand and appreciate science in general (...)."
  - "(...) this mode of representing science as an institution is found in interviews with senior scientists at an advanced stage in their career."
- "(...) Expert and Guardian coconstruct science as a collegial activity that makes the scientific organizations much less visible than the role of Research Managers, where the organizations are central for the sense making about what science is."
- "Neither Guardians of Science nor Experts (...) have fixed ideas about how younger researchers are supposed to learn to communicate."
- Punch line: "It seems that scientists learn to deal with journalists, companies, publics, and policy makers in much the same way as they learn to deal with administrative staff, travel budgets, library subscriptions, and coffee machines."

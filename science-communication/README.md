**Quotes, notes, and takeaways**:

- Focused on science journalism and the interaction between scientists and journalists.
- Science journalism as a non-opinionated science _loudspeaker_ vs. science critic.
- The article also addresses the crisis in journalism and the importance of the scientific community collaborating with the journalistic community (in terms of communication, in terms of recognition, and in terms of journalism programs, for example).
- "Many [scientists] tend to think of science journalism as a kind of public-relations service, existing purely to explain new scientific findings to the masses."
- "(...) society needs to see science scrutinized as well as regurgitated if it is to give science its trust, and journalists are an essential part of that process."
- "They [(science and journalism)] are built on the same foundation â€” the belief that conclusions require evidence; that the evidence should be open to everyone; and that everything is subject to question."

[`Communicating with Interactive Articles`](https://distill.pub/2020/communicating-with-interactive-articles/) | Fred Hohman, Matt Conlen, Jeffrey Heer, Duen Horng (Polo) Chau | 2020

**Quotes, notes, and takeaways**:

- Interactive articles: "Because diverse communities create interactive content, this medium goes by many different names and has not yet settled on a standardized format nor definition. (...) While these all slightly differ in their technical approach and target audience, they all largely leverage the interactivity of the modern web."
  - [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorable_explanation) for "Explorable explanation".
- Possible domains:
  - Research dissemination:
    - Opportunity: "Remove research debt, onboard new researchers".
    - Challenge: "No clear incentive structure for researchers".
  - Journalism.
  - Education.
  - Policy and decision making:
    - Challenge: "May require greater numeracy and graphicacy in audience".
- "(...) while the technology to distribute our ideas has grown (...), the interfaces have remained largely the same."
- "The most popular publishing platforms, for example WordPress and Medium, choose to prioritize social features and ease-of-use while limiting the ability for authors to communicate using the dynamic features of the web."
- Belief elicitation (interaction technique).
- Five affordances of interactive articles:
  - "Connecting People and Data."
  - "Making Systems Playful."
  - "Prompting Self-Reflection."
    - "Letting a reader first guess about data and only showing the ground truth afterwards challenges a reader's prior beliefs and has been shown to improve their recall of information [(through a click-and-drag chart/interface, for example)]."
    - "In the case of 'You Draw It,' readers were also shown the predictions that others made, adding a social comparison element to the experience. This additional social information was not shown to necessarily be effective for improving recall."
  - "Personalizing Reading."
    - "(...) automatically modifying text and multimedia based on a reader's individual features or input (...)."
  - "Reducing Cognitive Load."
    - Details-on-demand (interaction technique).
  - The authors colored the boundaries of the boxes of each affordance with the same color used in the line under each respective title.
- "(...) an audience which finds content to be aesthetically pleasing is more likely to have a positive attitude towards it."
- "While engagement itself may not be an end goal of most research communications, the ability to influence both audience attitude and the amount of time that is spent is a useful lever to improve learning: (...) time spent (...) and emotion (...) are predictive of learning outcomes."
- "Multiple representations give multiple perspectives."
- "Scientific data which is inherently **time varying** may be shown using an animation to connect viewers more closely with the original data, as compared to seeing an abstracted static view."
- "(...) by utilizing **animation**, it became possible for the authors to design a **unit visualization** in which each data point shown represented an individual (...)."
- "Using **person-shaped glyphs** (as opposed to abstract symbols like circles or squares) has been shown **not** to produce additional empathic responses (...)."
- "[Michael] Correll argues that much of the power of visualization comes from **abstraction**, but quantization stymies [(hinders)] empathy. He instead suggests anthropomorphizing data, borrowing journalistic and rhetoric techniques to create novel designs or interventions to foster empathy in readers when viewing visualizations."
- "(...) an ongoing debate within the data journalism community has been whether articles which utilize scroll-based graphics (scrollytelling) are more effective than those which use step-based graphics (slideshows)."
  - "[McKenna et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cgf.13195) found that their study participants largely preferred content to be displayed with a step- or scroll-based navigation as opposed to traditional static articles, but **did not** find a significant difference in engagement between the two layouts."
  - "[Zhi et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cgf.13719) found that performance on comprehension tasks was better in slideshow layouts than in vertical scroll-based layouts."
  - "Both studies focused on people using **desktop** (rather than mobile) devices."
- "Interactive articles commonly communicate a **single idea** or concept using **multiple representations**."
- "The Multimedia Principle states that **people learn better from words and pictures** rather than words or pictures alone, as people can process information through both a visual channel and auditory channel simultaneously."
- "While testing may call to mind stressful educational experiences for many, quizzes included in web articles can be low stakes: there is no need to record the results or grade readers."
- "(...) 'personalized spatial analogies,' presenting distance measurements in regions where readers are geographically familiar with, help people more concretely understand new distance measurements within news stories."
- "In practice, the solidified standard for details-on-demand in data visualization manifests as a tooltip, typically summoned on a cursor mouseover (...)."
- "(...) text documents and other long-form textual mediums have also experimented with letting readers choose a variable level of detail to read."
  - [Example](https://parametric.press/issue-01/call-for-proposals/).
- "Details-on-demand can also be used as a method for previewing content without committing to another interaction or change of view."
- "The act of creating a successful interactive article is **closer to building a website** than writing a blog post (...)."
- "The current generation of authoring tools do not acknowledge this collaboration [between several people with different skills]."
- There's a "(...) need for improved tooling in this area, specifically around the archiving of interactive articles."
  - "Specific features should include supporting mobile-friendly adaptations of interactive graphics (...), creating content for different platforms besides just the web, and tools that allow people to create interactive content without code."
- "We were also forced to craft designs [for _The Parametric Press_] under a more realistic set of constraints (...): when creating a visualization it is **not enough** to choose the most effective visual encodings, the graphics also had to be aesthetically appealing, adhere to a house style, have minimal impact on page load time and runtime performance, be legible on both mobile and desktop devices, and not be overly burdensome to implement."
- "There is **limited empirical evaluation** of the effectiveness of interactive articles. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that large publishers are unwilling to share internal metrics, and laboratory studies may not generalize to real world reading trends."

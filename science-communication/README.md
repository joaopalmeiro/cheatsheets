[`Cheerleader or watchdog?`](https://www.nature.com/articles/4591033a) | _Nature_ **459**, 1033 | 2009

Tuesday, September 29, 2020

**Quotes, notes, and takeaways**:

- Focused on science journalism and the interaction between scientists and journalists.
- Science journalism as a non-opinionated science _loudspeaker_ vs. science critic.
- The article also addresses the crisis in journalism and the importance of the scientific community collaborating with the journalistic community (in terms of communication, in terms of recognition, and in terms of journalism programs, for example).
- "Many [scientists] tend to think of science journalism as a kind of public-relations service, existing purely to explain new scientific findings to the masses."
- "(...) society needs to see science scrutinized as well as regurgitated if it is to give science its trust, and journalists are an essential part of that process."
- "They [(science and journalism)] are built on the same foundation â€” the belief that conclusions require evidence; that the evidence should be open to everyone; and that everything is subject to question."

[`Communicating with Interactive Articles`](https://distill.pub/2020/communicating-with-interactive-articles/) | Fred Hohman, Matt Conlen, Jeffrey Heer, Duen Horng (Polo) Chau | 2020 | [Repo](https://github.com/distillpub/post--communicating-with-interactive-articles)

Sunday, October 4, 2020

**Quotes, notes, and takeaways**:

- Interactive articles: "Because diverse communities create interactive content, this medium goes by many different names and has not yet settled on a standardized format nor definition. (...) While these all slightly differ in their technical approach and target audience, they all largely leverage the interactivity of the modern web."
  - [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorable_explanation) for "Explorable explanation".
- Possible domains:
  - Research dissemination:
    - Opportunity: "Remove research debt, onboard new researchers".
    - Challenge: "No clear incentive structure for researchers".
  - Journalism.
  - Education.
  - Policy and decision making:
    - Challenge: "May require greater numeracy and graphicacy in audience".
- "(...) while the technology to distribute our ideas has grown (...), the interfaces have remained largely the same."
- "The most popular publishing platforms, for example WordPress and Medium, choose to prioritize social features and ease-of-use while limiting the ability for authors to communicate using the dynamic features of the web."
- Belief elicitation (interaction technique).
- Five affordances of interactive articles:
  - "Connecting People and Data."
  - "Making Systems Playful."
  - "Prompting Self-Reflection."
    - "Letting a reader first guess about data and only showing the ground truth afterwards challenges a reader's prior beliefs and has been shown to improve their recall of information [(through a click-and-drag chart/interface, for example)]."
    - "In the case of 'You Draw It,' readers were also shown the predictions that others made, adding a social comparison element to the experience. This additional social information was not shown to necessarily be effective for improving recall."
  - "Personalizing Reading."
    - "(...) automatically modifying text and multimedia based on a reader's individual features or input (...)."
  - "Reducing Cognitive Load."
    - Details-on-demand (interaction technique).
  - The authors colored the boundaries of the boxes of each affordance with the same color used in the line under each respective title.
- "(...) an audience which finds content to be aesthetically pleasing is more likely to have a positive attitude towards it."
- "While engagement itself may not be an end goal of most research communications, the ability to influence both audience attitude and the amount of time that is spent is a useful lever to improve learning: (...) time spent (...) and emotion (...) are predictive of learning outcomes."
- "Multiple representations give multiple perspectives."
- "Scientific data which is inherently **time varying** may be shown using an animation to connect viewers more closely with the original data, as compared to seeing an abstracted static view."
- "(...) by utilizing **animation**, it became possible for the authors to design a **unit visualization** in which each data point shown represented an individual (...)."
- "Using **person-shaped glyphs** (as opposed to abstract symbols like circles or squares) has been shown **not** to produce additional empathic responses (...)."
- "[Michael] Correll argues that much of the power of visualization comes from **abstraction**, but quantization stymies [(hinders)] empathy. He instead suggests anthropomorphizing data, borrowing journalistic and rhetoric techniques to create novel designs or interventions to foster empathy in readers when viewing visualizations."
- "(...) an ongoing debate within the data journalism community has been whether articles which utilize scroll-based graphics (scrollytelling) are more effective than those which use step-based graphics (slideshows)."
  - "[McKenna et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cgf.13195) found that their study participants largely preferred content to be displayed with a step- or scroll-based navigation as opposed to traditional static articles, but **did not** find a significant difference in engagement between the two layouts."
  - "[Zhi et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cgf.13719) found that performance on comprehension tasks was better in slideshow layouts than in vertical scroll-based layouts."
  - "Both studies focused on people using **desktop** (rather than mobile) devices."
- "Interactive articles commonly communicate a **single idea** or concept using **multiple representations**."
- "The Multimedia Principle states that **people learn better from words and pictures** rather than words or pictures alone, as people can process information through both a visual channel and auditory channel simultaneously."
- "While testing may call to mind stressful educational experiences for many, quizzes included in web articles can be low stakes: there is no need to record the results or grade readers."
- "(...) 'personalized spatial analogies,' presenting distance measurements in regions where readers are geographically familiar with, help people more concretely understand new distance measurements within news stories."
- "In practice, the solidified standard for details-on-demand in data visualization manifests as a tooltip, typically summoned on a cursor mouseover (...)."
- "(...) text documents and other long-form textual mediums have also experimented with letting readers choose a variable level of detail to read."
  - [Example](https://parametric.press/issue-01/call-for-proposals/).
- "Details-on-demand can also be used as a method for previewing content without committing to another interaction or change of view."
- "The act of creating a successful interactive article is **closer to building a website** than writing a blog post (...)."
- "The current generation of authoring tools do not acknowledge this collaboration [between several people with different skills]."
- There's a "(...) need for improved tooling in this area, specifically around the archiving of interactive articles."
  - "Specific features should include supporting mobile-friendly adaptations of interactive graphics (...), creating content for different platforms besides just the web, and tools that allow people to create interactive content without code."
- "We were also forced to craft designs [for _The Parametric Press_] under a more realistic set of constraints (...): when creating a visualization it is **not enough** to choose the most effective visual encodings, the graphics also had to be aesthetically appealing, adhere to a house style, have minimal impact on page load time and runtime performance, be legible on both mobile and desktop devices, and not be overly burdensome to implement."
- "There is **limited empirical evaluation** of the effectiveness of interactive articles. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that large publishers are unwilling to share internal metrics, and laboratory studies may not generalize to real world reading trends."

[`Translating Scientific Graphics for Public Audiences`](https://c4pgv.dbvis.de/Qiao_Hullman_2018.pdf) | Xiaoli Qiao, Jessica Hullman | 2018

Sunday, October 4, 2020

**Quotes, notes, and takeaways**:

- "(...) it remains rare for many scientists to have to communicate to the public directly."
- The authors qualitatively analyzed "(...) 20 diagrams that represent journalists' redesigns of scientific graphics targeted at a general audience."
  - The authors limited their choices "(...) to graphics that were evidently derived from the original graphics."
  - The authors "(...) adopted an open-ended coding approach in which each author independently analyzed the same subset of samples. After analyzing the first subset, [the authors] (...) labeled the design strategies and created a basic taxonomy. [The authors] (...) then applied the taxonomy to the rest of [the] (...) samples, adding new labels when necessary, and resolving disagreements."
- Using bold text to identify techniques/strategies is a very good way to highlight the most important information.
- Five categories of techniques:
  - "Simplification":
    - "(...) simplify the language."
      - "(...) spell out acronyms (...)."
      - "(...) rewriting existing labels in simpler language (...)."
      - "(...) adding a description of the unit or scale (...)."
    - "(...) simplify the interpretation."
      - "(...) break the visualization into steps."
      - "Changing the measurement (...)."
      - "(...) intentionally leave out some information (...)."
      - Tricky: "(...) remove visualization of uncertainty (such as by removing error bars or descriptions of margins of error)."
    - "(...) simplification is often **not** addressed directly in more canonical examples of visualization guidance (...)."
  - "Optimizing the Visual Presentation":
    - "(...) change the colors (...)."
    - "(...) change the visual encoding (...)."
      - In one example, "(...) the researchers used a diverging color palette to show temperature from low to high, but the journalist, in the edited version, changed it to a simpler sequential color scheme (...)."
    - "(...) add a [double] visual encoding (...)."
    - "(...) add a visualization of data [(table)] (...)."
    - "(...) change orientation or ordering of parts of a figure, typically for aesthetic reasons."
  - "Adding Explanation":
    - "(...) explanation of the content (...)."
      - "(...) add title (...)."
      - "(...) provide background information or summary (...)."
    - "(...) explanation of the graph (...)."
      - "(...) add labels to part of the diagram (...)."
      - "(...) indicate how to read the graph (...) or directly interpret the pattern shown in the original graph, both typically through annotation."
  - "Making Information Relatable":
    - "(...) use more realistic illustrations."
    - "(...) add a reference to a familiar object."
    - "Adding pictorial objects purely to support recognition of some object or entity conflicts with canonical guidance like the data-ink maximization ratio (...)."
    - "(...) provide a typical case [(baseline)] for the audience to better understand the special case (...)."
  - "Miscellaneous":
    - "(...) added or changed information groupings from the original diagram."
    - "(...) add new data or information."
- "These strategies appear to be influenced by principles that run **orthogonal** to most canonical visualization design guidance, which focuses on the clarity of the encodings but does not necessarily address how to scaffold understanding through textual and graphical elements."

[`Ethics and Statistics: The AAA Tranche of Subprime Science`](https://stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/ChanceEthics10.pdf) | Andrew Gelman, Eric Loken | 2014

Sunday, October 11, 2020

**Quotes, notes, and takeaways**:

- One of the main roles of statistics/quantitative research is to recognize and communicate uncertainty (and variation/variance), particularly important because "(...) we have a tendency to think more categorically about things as being true or false, there or not there (...)."
- Based on the above point, statistics should not be used "(...) to overstate confidence."
- The authors use an analogy ("(...) AAA-class bonds created during the mid-2000s that led to the subprime mortgage crisis.") to talk about research, especially statistical significance and the publication/peer review (qualitative) process, to highlight some problems with these instruments (commonly considered as _seals of approval_).
- The authors also complement the article with an analogy about food safety certification.
- The (main) motivation for the article is "(...) to stress how it [(the current system)] is used as a way of laundering uncertainty, creating AAA tranches of strong claims from masses of data and analyses of varying quality."
- In this way, the authors think it is necessary "(...) to accept large levels of uncertainty and to move beyond the paradigm in which effective certainty can be obtained via statistical significance and peer review."
- Statistical significance comes from "(...) high-certainty statements selected out of the many less-reliable claims."
- "The convention is to treat published claims as true unless demonstrated otherwise."
- "The two-step process â€” first the achievement of statistical significance, then publication â€” corresponds with the movement of a scientific hypothesis from the hazy [(_nebulosa_)] zone of uncertain speculation to presumed certainty."
- Three reasons why peer review does not guarantee error filtering:
  - "(...) any paper is publishable if you try enough outlets."
  - "(...) journals select on novelty as much as correctness."
  - "(...) reviewers and publishers may be independent with respect to a specific article they review, but they are not independent in that they participate in related projects and in the broader scientific enterprise where publications are the currency for success and promotion."
- The authors "(...) believe that what many researchers (...) are more likely to defend is a general _research hypothesis_, rather than the specific empirical findings."
- "(...) selection on statistical significance induces a positive bias in the magnitude of any comparison, and the reported estimate represents just one possible comparison that could have been performed on these data."
- The authors also speak of mechanisms (mitigators) that would involve money, such as scientific prediction markets.
- "(...) scientific prediction markets could be a step forward, just because it would facilitate clear predictive statements about replications. If a researcher believes in his or her theory, even while not willing to bet his or her published quantitative finding would reappear in a replication, that's fine, but it would be good to see such a statement openly made."
- The authors "(...) think the problem is that often researchers do not admit uncertainty or variation; they think they've already made their discovery, and they think of various data-collection and data-analysis rules as technicalities that should not get in the way of science."
- "A few significant _p_-values give the illusion of a high rating to the whole set of results, and this illusion of certainty is then used to justify a discussion section devoted to the general scientific hypothesis."
- To keep in mind: "Documenting the details of research studies, including all the relevant decisions in the design and the data analysis, is important for being able to reproduce, evaluate, and replicate results."
- "(...) academic researchers may feel freer to inflate the importance of their findings because they are removed from decisionmaking."
- On the Twitter thread where I found this article ([shared by Jessica Hullman](https://twitter.com/JessicaHullman/status/1315009954831650816)), there is a very interesting [comment from Enrico Bertini](https://twitter.com/FILWD/status/1314625884599529474) about the publishers: "**They sell a brand.** It's like asking why do you need a one thousand bucks Prada shirt for something you can buy at \$5."

[`A Field of Expertise, the Organization, or Science Itself? Scientistsâ€™ Perception of Representing Research in Public Communication`](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1075547013487513) | Maja Horst | 2013

Wednesday, December 30, 2020

**Quotes, notes, and takeaways**:

- Modes of representation (typology):
  - Expert (field of expertise).
  - Research Manager (research organization).
  - Guardian of Science (institution of science).
- Research design:
  - Qualitative.
  - Semi-structured interviews.
  - 20 leading Danish (bio- and nanotechnology) scientists.
- "When scientists communicate publicly, they do not just disseminate knowledge, they also represent a particular sense making about what science, scientists, and scientific organizations are."
- "One study found that previous behavior is the most important predictor for whether scientists are likely to engage in public communication (Poliakoff & Webb, 2007). This implies that scientists either engage in science communication on a **continuous basis** or they **do not do it at all**."
- "Just as **top leaders of large companies** often become the central focus point for sense making about that company (Guthey, Clark, & Jackson, 2009), **top scientists** often symbolize science and its organizations in public communication."
- "Approximately one half of the interviewees seemed to move between these roles depending on the context. The other half of the interviewees talked primarily about one of the roles, but they also occasionally said things that could be ascribed to a secondary role."
  - "In practice, (...) scientists will adopt these modes of representing to a larger or lesser degree and in various combinations."
- **Field of expertise**:
  - The most common mode of representation.
  - "(...) the interviewee does not speak on behalf of his university or colleagues but only answers to himself for what he says."
  - "(...) he does not speak as a private person but that he has a particular academic position, from which he can speak knowledgably about a field."
  - "This scientist [(there is at least one other scientist who sees no problems)] does not want to be seen to talk about scientific topics outside her field of expertise."
  - "(...) communication is rarely described as a favorite activity."
  - "Their main concern when speaking in public is that the content, the facts, are correct."
  - Often, they have only vague notions about the target audience.
  - "Interviewees within biotechnology seem to have more experiences with joint collegial reflections on communication than interviewees within nanotechnology. (...) scientists within biotechnology have lived with pronounced public controversy about their field for a very long time."
  - Commenting on each other's communication activities "(...) should be done not as a part of managerial instruction but rather as a conversation between two equal researchers."
- **Research organization**:
  - "(...) their brand is primarily built on what they do (...)."
  - "They demonstrate their **research excellence** by communicating about publications in top journals, and they demonstrate **research relevance** by making it visible that they have a large number of collaborative projects with companies and other organizations."
  - They "(...) do not think it is right for them to use their managerial position to interfere with what their colleagues and group members choose to say in public."
  - "Not only can **language** be a problem in terms of communicating to a national public that is not English speaking, but this interviewee also points out that a **shared cultural frame of reference** is necessary if public science communication is to succeed."
  - "In general, the training of communication competences **does not** seem to be a systematic part of research management. (...) the interviewees drawing on this mode of representing primarily seem to understand communication skills as the result of inborn personality traits."
    - However, "(...) Research Managers might consider communication competencies as something that has to be acquired more systematically."
  - "Mostly, these interviewees seem to consider it their own duty as managers of a research group or center to represent the organization and not something they can delegate to others."
- **Institution of science**:
  - "Communication efforts (...) motivated by a wish to help citizens understand and appreciate science in general (...)."
  - "(...) this mode of representing science as an institution is found in interviews with senior scientists at an advanced stage in their career."
- "(...) Expert and Guardian coconstruct science as a collegial activity that makes the scientific organizations much less visible than the role of Research Managers, where the organizations are central for the sense making about what science is."
- "Neither Guardians of Science nor Experts (...) have fixed ideas about how younger researchers are supposed to learn to communicate."
- Punch line: "It seems that scientists learn to deal with journalists, companies, publics, and policy makers in much the same way as they learn to deal with administrative staff, travel budgets, library subscriptions, and coffee machines."

[`Communicating through humour: A project of stand-up comedy about science`](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963662513511175) | Bruno Pinto, David MarÃ§al, Sofia G. Vaz | 2013 | [Video](https://youtu.be/tanT2AfMhA8) | [Supplementary material](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0963662513511175/suppl_file/PUS511175_APPENDIX.pdf)

Wednesday, January 6, 2021

**Quotes, notes, and takeaways**:

- "The application of stand-up comedy to science communication is still uncommon but has been gaining momentum in recent years in the United States of America and the United Kingdom."
- "(...) staging science events at these "generic" locations has the potential to reach audiences with little or no interest in science activities (Bultitude and Sardo, 2012)."
- Participants (scientists):
  - 13 participants.
  - The qualitative study was carried out with 11 out of 13 participants. "The first and third authors of the present study were participants in the project and, therefore, were excluded from the analysis to avoid bias (...)."
  - 6 women and 5 men.
  - 7 different scientific areas.
  - 4 MSc researchers.
  - 6 PhD students.
  - 1 Postdoctoral researcher.
  - "Between 2009 and 2013, the group performed in science-related facilities (...) but also other types of venues (...)."
  - 36 presentations in total, "(...) with an estimated audience of over 6000 people."
- Audience:
  - Adult audience.
  - The authors obtained (quantitative) feedback from the audience (through a closed-ended questionnaire) only at **one** of the shows, more precisely from 35 out of 70 audience members. "(...) the **audience**, most of whom were young adults, and held a higher education degree, were satisfied with the show."
  - This show "(...) was done at a venue directed towards science communication [(Museu da CiÃªncia, a science museum in Coimbra)] (...)."
  - Age (years):
    - `18â€“25`: 9.
    - `26â€“40`: 11.
    - `41â€“60`: 9.
    - `>60`: 6.
  - 24 women and 11 men.
  - Professional situation:
    - `Employed`: 22.
    - `Unemployed`: 1.
    - `Student`: 7.
    - `Retired`: 5.
    - `Housewife`: 0.
  - Education level completed:
    - `Primary education`: 0.
    - `Basic education`: 0.
    - `Secondary education`: 2.
    - `BSc level`: 9.
    - `MSc level`: 16.
    - `PhD level`: 8.
- "(...) some \[participants\] mentioned that they would only encourage peers who were already interested in science communication."
- "In relation to the drawbacks of using this format, several respondents said that the clarity and simplicity demanded by a science stand-up comedy act aimed at the general public could also be a limitation. (...) Concern about passing on information that was considered scientifically correct in a clear way through humour was also mentioned."
- One participant "(...) thinks that this form of science communication is effective in attracting audiences who already have an interest in science, but **may not be able to capture the attention of all the lay public**."
- "What seems to be different in the present study is that the difficulties were viewed from a positive perspective, as a challenge that could be overcome."
- "The project was open to all the local scientific community but did not attract researchers in more advanced stages of their careers."
- "The format of stand-up comedy on science could be classified as a deficit-like communication (or diffusionist model), since it is mainly a one-way communication in which scientific knowledge is popularized (...). However, it has the advantage of establishing a close relationship with the audiences, which may be explained by the use of humour, informal language and generally talking to the audience as equals."
- Quote: "It should also be said that simplicity and informality should not be confused with lack of accuracy."

**Quotes, notes, and takeaways**:

- Focused on science journalism and the interaction between scientists and journalists.
- Science journalism as a non-opinionated science _loudspeaker_ vs. science critic.
- The article also addresses the crisis in journalism and the importance of the scientific community collaborating with the journalistic community (in terms of communication, in terms of recognition, and in terms of journalism programs, for example).
- "Many [scientists] tend to think of science journalism as a kind of public-relations service, existing purely to explain new scientific findings to the masses."
- "(...) society needs to see science scrutinized as well as regurgitated if it is to give science its trust, and journalists are an essential part of that process."
- "They [(science and journalism)] are built on the same foundation â€” the belief that conclusions require evidence; that the evidence should be open to everyone; and that everything is subject to question."

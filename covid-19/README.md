**Quotes, notes, and takeaways**:

- "(...) containment measures do seem to work, means that the basic reproduction number [R<sub>0</sub>] is probably in the lower bound of the 1.3-6.5 range, and can decrease below 1 with proper measures."
- "The most widely quoted CFR has been 3.4%, reported by WHO dividing the number of deaths by documented cases in early March. This ignores undetected infections and the strong age dependence of CFR."
- "The most complete data come from Diamond Princess passengers, with CFR = 1% observed in an elderly cohort; thus, CFR may be much lower than 1% in the general population, probably higher than seasonal flu (CFR = 0.1%), but not much so."
- "Observed crude CFR in South Korea and in Germany, the countries with most extensive testing, is 0.9% and 0.2%, respectively, as of March 14, and crude CFR in Scandinavian countries is about 0.1%."
- "Part of the growth of documented cases could reflect rapid increases in numbers of coronavirus tests performed."
- "China data are more compatible with close contact rather than wide community spread being the main mode of transmission."
- "A systematic review on measures to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses found insufficient evidence for entry port screening and social distancing in reducing epidemic spreading. Plain hygienic measures have the strongest evidence."
- "Most lives saved may actually be due to reduced transmission of influenza rather than coronavirus."
- "Most evidence on protective measures comes from non-randomized studies prone to bias. (...) only two randomized trials, one on hand sanitizer and another on facemasks and hand hygiene in household members of people infected with influenza."
- "Policymakers feel pressure from opponents who lambast inaction. Also, adoption of measures in one institution, jurisdiction or country creates pressure for taking similar measures elsewhere under fear of being accused of negligence."
- "For patients without severe symptoms, hospitalizations offer no benefit and may only infect health workers causing shortage of much-needed personnel."
- "Focusing on protecting susceptible individuals may be preferable to maintaining countrywide lockdowns longterm."
- "(...) some political decisions may be confounded with alternative motives. Lockdowns weaponized by suppressive regimes can create a precedent for easy adoption in the future. Closure of borders may serve policies focused on limiting immigration."
- "Leading figures insist that the current situation is a once-in-a-century pandemic. A corollary might be that any reaction to it, no matter how extreme, is justified."
- "This year's coronavirus outbreak is clearly unprecedented in amount of attention received. A Google search with "coronavirus" yielded 3 550 000 000 results on March 3 and 9 440 000 000 results on March 14. Conversely, "influenza" attracted 30- to 60-fold less attention although this season it has caused so far more deaths globally than coronavirus."
- "Leaving the well-known and highly lethal SARS and MERS coronaviruses aside, other coronaviruses probably have infected millions of people and have killed thousands. However, it is only this year that every single case and every single death gets red alert broadcasting in the news."
- Comparisons with the 1918 influenza pandemic:
  - "Retrospective data (...) early adoption of social distancing measures was associated with lower peak death rates."
  - "(...) these data are sparse, retrospective and pathogen-specific. Moreover, total deaths were eventually little affected by early social distancing: people just died several weeks later."
- An easy-to-read paper, regardless of personal background, with lots of food for thought.

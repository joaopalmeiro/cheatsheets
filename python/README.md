# Python

## Notes

These notes are based on Real Python's "[Getting the Most Out of a Python Traceback](https://realpython.com/courses/python-traceback/)" course:

- Traceback: A kind of report composed of function calls at a given point.
- In Python, it is recommended to read the traceback from the bottom up.
- There are differences in the output between the command line and the REPL environment (instead of filenames, `"<stdin>"` is obtained, for example).

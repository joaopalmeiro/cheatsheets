[`Truncating the Y-Axis: Threat or Menace?`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02035) | Michael Correll, Enrico Bertini, Steven Franconeri | 2020 (v2) | [Repo](https://github.com/mcorrell/truncation)

Sunday, April 12, 2020

**Quotes, notes, and takeaways**:

- "Y-axis truncation breaks the visual conventions of bar charts, as the relative ratio of heights between two bars is no longer proportional to their difference in value (a bar that is twice as high may not represent a value that is twice as large)."
- "By contrast, when trends, rather than individual values, are important components of the intended messages, there are some cases where _not_ truncating the y-axis is perceived as deceptive."
- "designers must take into account the range and magnitude of effect sizes they wish to communicate at a per-data and per-task level."
- "The results of our first experiment show no robust difference in the impact of truncation on bar charts and line charts: truncation results in largely **qualitatively** assessed effect sizes in both types of graphs."
- "The second experiment indicates that even designs \[broken axis bar chart and gradient bar chart\] that explicitly call attention to axis breaks do not have a noticeable impact on reducing the subjectively assessed trend."
- "Surprisingly, \[the\] accurate estimation of values does not seem to counteract the visual magnification of difference."
- "Our experimental results suggest that truncating the y-axis has a consistent and significant impact on the perceived importance of effect sizes."
- "This bias is not merely a misreading of values, but seems to be connected to the visual magnification of differences."
- "Moreover, we cannot _rely_ on visual indicators of broken or truncated axes to counteract the exaggeration caused by y-axis truncation. Subjective judgments about effect size appear to be _visual_ rather than _mathematical_ or _statistical_ judgments."
- "We reject the unequivocal dichotomy of "honest" and "dishonest" charts (...)."
- Crowdsourced study via [Prolific](https://www.prolific.co/).
- The authors did not consider interactive charts, only static ones.
- The study was conducted in a "relatively context-free manner" (it was not focused on a specific domain, for example).

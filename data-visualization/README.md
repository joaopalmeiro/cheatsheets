[`Truncating the Y-Axis: Threat or Menace?`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02035) | Michael Correll, Enrico Bertini, Steven Franconeri | 2020 (v2) | [Repo](https://github.com/mcorrell/truncation)

Sunday, April 12, 2020

**Quotes, notes, and takeaways**:

- "Y-axis truncation breaks the visual conventions of bar charts, as the relative ratio of heights between two bars is no longer proportional to their difference in value (a bar that is twice as high may not represent a value that is twice as large)."
- "By contrast, when trends, rather than individual values, are important components of the intended messages, there are some cases where _not_ truncating the y-axis is perceived as deceptive."
- "designers must take into account the range and magnitude of effect sizes they wish to communicate at a per-data and per-task level."
- "The results of our first experiment show no robust difference in the impact of truncation on bar charts and line charts: truncation results in largely **qualitatively** assessed effect sizes in both types of graphs."
- "The second experiment indicates that even designs \[broken axis bar chart and gradient bar chart\] that explicitly call attention to axis breaks do not have a noticeable impact on reducing the subjectively assessed trend."
- "Surprisingly, \[the\] accurate estimation of values does not seem to counteract the visual magnification of difference."
- "Our experimental results suggest that truncating the y-axis has a consistent and significant impact on the perceived importance of effect sizes."
- "This bias is not merely a misreading of values, but seems to be connected to the visual magnification of differences."
- "Moreover, we cannot _rely_ on visual indicators of broken or truncated axes to counteract the exaggeration caused by y-axis truncation. Subjective judgments about effect size appear to be _visual_ rather than _mathematical_ or _statistical_ judgments."
- "We reject the unequivocal dichotomy of "honest" and "dishonest" charts (...)."
- Crowdsourced study via [Prolific](https://www.prolific.co/).
- The authors did not consider interactive charts, only static ones.
- The study was conducted in a "relatively context-free manner" (it was not focused on a specific domain, for example).

[`Belief at first sight: Data visualization and the rationalization of seeing`](https://benjamins.com/catalog/idj.25.1.04kos) | Doris Kosminsky, Jagoda Walny, Jo Vermeulen, Søren Knudsen, Wesley Willett, Sheelagh Carpendale | 2019

**Quotes, notes, and takeaways**:

- "(...) Mercator projection causes northern countries to appear larger than they truly are."
- The authors "(...) argue that the implicit association with objectivity creates a risk that visualizations can be perceived uncritically and with a limited understanding of the influences that shaped their message, especially at first sight."
  - "(...) belief at first sight — the uncritical perception of visualizations as a sufficient representation of reality."
- Data Visualization as a mode of representation (Nelson Goodman's Theory of Symbols).
- In 2008, a streamgraph "(...) was a new and relatively unknown data representation. Ten years later, this format is included in automatic visualization generation tools such as [Rawgraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/) (...)."
- "In this way, this conventionally agreed-upon form of representing the visible world \[perspective\] comes to be understood as representing the world "as it is". However, scholars have argued over whether these drawing rules indeed portray perspective as the one "natural" or "correct" mode of representation of a scene, or if they instead reflect a convention for exhibiting three-dimensional scenes."
  - "It is now well known that the static eye assumption is an impossibility (...) Thus how can perspective truly portray reality when it is based on an impossibility?"
- "This leads to the idea of a camera as a mechanical or autonomous image production device that excludes human bias. If the reproduction of what is in front of the camera is automatic, then it is assumed to be objective."
  - "The film's bias in favor of Caucasian skin \["whiteness" bias\] was largely accepted by the public at the time, obscured by the dominant concept that science, the basis for film production, was based on reasoned decisions without racial or cultural considerations (...)."
- "A key feature of data visualization is that it involves two distinct and separable representational stages. First, a set of data represents some aspects of the world. Second, a data visualization represents the data set and thus becomes a representation of the world."
- "A long-running stream of data visualization research investigates the connection between visualizations and the human perceptual system (...) with the purpose of increasing the interpretability of the underlying data."
  - "Tufte's (...) data-ink ratio (...) has been debated as studies have shown that extraneous elements can improve the memorability of visualizations (...)."
  - "By viewing perspective and photography as modes of representation parallel to visualization, we see that the historical context in which each came to be associated with objectivity and rationalism continues in data visualization. It becomes clear that the data visualization community's discussions of representational accuracy are rooted in discussions of "correct" representations that have endured across many centuries and representational modes."
- "(...) most visualizations represent data that is already an imperfect or incomplete representation of the world."
  - Data provenance/lineage is an important concept for transparency.
- "Placing perspective, early photography, and data visualization along a historical continuum, we can see a **tendency to systematize and automate methods of producing representations**, from using rules, to machines, to algorithms."
- "What we see is intertwined with our individual and cultural experiences, which are influenced by the history of how visual media have been perceived — as a way to portray an objective reality."
  - "(...) from a cultural point of view, belief at first sight can also happen when a society in general views a medium as fundamentally objective without further critique."
- "Understanding visualization is a shared responsibility between those who create, acquire, or select data (data providers), those who create representations of data (visualization creators) and those who read or use the visualization (analysts and viewers)."
- Three points to keep in mind:
  - **Deeper visualization literacy**: "Studying and teaching the trajectories and critiques of analogous modes of representation can help creators and audiences alike gain awareness of and contextualize the changes happening in data visualization. Visualization creators can deepen their own visualization literacy by studying and considering data visualization as a part of the historical representation process".
  - **Awareness of black boxes**: "(...) many aspects of visualization can be hidden in "black boxes", from data collection and processing steps, to representation algorithms, to the reasoning behind design choices. Black boxes can be found where there is the greatest risk that viewers' understanding of the relationship between a visualization and the world will break down."
  - **Develop critical reflexivity in visualization**.
- The authors "(...) conclude with the proposal that visualization is not about aspiring to show the most objective, neutral, and unbiased view, but rather about being aware of the context in which the data was collected, represented, framed and viewed, and the possible biases that may have influenced their portrayal."
